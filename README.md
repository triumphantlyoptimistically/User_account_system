# User Account Task Manager

A Python application that allows users to register and log in, with each user managing their own persistent task list.

This project demonstrates core software engineering concepts such as authentication, user-specific data handling, and file-based persistence.

## Why This Project
This project was built to practise fundamental software engineering skills required for junior and apprenticeship roles.  
It focuses on structuring a program logically, managing application state, handling multiple users, and persisting data reliably between runs.

The project reflects real-world development patterns used in larger applications, implemented in a simplified command-line environment.
